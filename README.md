## TODO

- [ ] Adding the 5 fold cross-validation folders for Kenyan food/non-food classifier as well as Kenyan Food Type Recognizer in Google Drive

- [ ] Adding documentation how to run the scraping script with a minimal example for both hashtag-based as well as location-based scenarios.

- [ ] Adding documentation for running the Kenyan Food/Non-Food Classifier as well as Kenyan Food Type Recognizer both in Shared Cluster Center (SCC@BU) as well as on a Deep Learning station.

- [ ] Adding a requirement.txt that shows all the necessary packages for this project.
